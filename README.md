# LovewebOS
### A linux operating system based completely off of Shadok's Loveweb series on youtube!

- This project is in early, EARLY development, so I don't have any working ISOs yet. If you want to contribute to this in any way, whether through development, tips, or even making art, feel free to email me! I'd really appreciate anyone who wants to help make this a reality.
- This WILL be a thing, no matter how long it takes. So if this interests you, know it won't be scrapped before a release. Even if it's pretty bad at fist :p
